        <p>The week following Thanksgiving marks New York City's official transformation into the world's most romantic winter wonderland, where couples can witness the magical transition from autumn gratitude to holiday enchantment while building intimate memories during the season's most spectacular debut. This week, from November 25th through December 1st, culminates in the legendary Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony on Wednesday evening, but the magic extends throughout every neighborhood as holiday decorations bloom, ice rinks open, and the city embraces its role as the global capital of seasonal romance.
